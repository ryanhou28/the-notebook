    "text": "1.2 Analog vs Digital\nIn contrast to the discrete digital signals, analog signals are continuous. Signals from the physical world are inherently analog (e.g. sound, light, temperature, voltage). However, modern computing systems are primarily digital because of several key advantages:\n\nReliability: Provides more noise resistance since it operates at low or high levels\nDigitized signals can represent analog values with good precision given enough digits\nEase of data storage, transmission, and compression\nDigital circuit components are more cost-effective and scalable compared to analog components",

    "text": "1.3 (Very) High-Level Digital Circuit Design Flow\nInsert high-level design flow figure here\nThe design flow of a digital circuit starts off with a problem statement or design specification. Digital circuits are then described by the designer in a Hardware Description Language (HDL), most commonly Verilog/SystemVerilog or VHDL. The design is then simulated with a testbench, which feeds the design with test inputs. During simulation, we can use tools to inspect the state of the signals in the circuit to analyze, debug, and evaluate the design. At this point, such a behavioral description of the design merely describes the functionality and not yet its physical implementation. Synthesis maps the behavioral description of the design into netlist of standard cells, which indicates the physical mapping to circuit components. The place and route process then physically places the netlist of cells and routes the wires to connect the components, generating a hardware implementation.\nThis notebook will cover basic Verilog. For more in-depth notes on Verilog/SystemVerilog, please refer to my other notebook.",
