# Signal Transform

What is signal transform?

- Basis
- Coefficients

Transform Examples:

- DFT (FFT)
- DCT
- Wavelet Transform
- Laplace Transform, Z transform, ...

Why signal transform needed?

- Feature extraction
- Compression (compact signal representation)
- Complexity reduction
- Easier manipulation and analysis of signal

## DFT, IDFT

### Orthogonal Basis Function

### Linear vs Circular Convolution

## Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
