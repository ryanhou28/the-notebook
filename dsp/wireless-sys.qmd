# Wireless Communication Systems


- Source Coding
  - Entropy coding, transform compression, compressive sensing
    - Entropy Coding: Uses principles from information theory (Shannon entropy) to remove redundancy. Examples: Huffman coding, Arithmetic coding.
    - Transform Compression: Uses mathematical transforms (e.g., DCT in JPEG, FFT in OFDM) to represent signals efficiently.
    - Compressive Sensing: Uses sparse signal representations to reduce the number of required samples while preserving information.
- Cryptography
  - Authentication, encryption
  - Mostly in finite field arithmetic
- Channel Coding
  - Error correction coding: convolutional code, block code, Polar, LDPC,turbo code, ...


## Modulation

High-level: Converts digital data into analog signals for transmission.

### Linear Modulation

Used in WiFi, LTE, 5G due to efficient spectral usage.


### Non-Linear Modulation

Used in Bluetooth, GSM due to power efficiency.

### Passband Modulation

High-level: Involves shifting baseband signals to a higher frequency for RF transmission.

## Wireless Channel Model

## Demodulation

High-level: The process of recovering transmitted data.

### Demodulation: Down-Conversion

High-level: Converts the received RF signal back to baseband using a local oscillator.

### Demodulation: AWGN, Linear & Non-Linear Modulation

- AWGN: Basic noise model.
- Linear & Non-Linear Modulation: Different detection techniques apply based on the modulation scheme.

### OFDM

(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)

Uses multiple subcarriers to mitigate frequency-selective fading.
Used in WiFi, LTE, 5G.

### Zigbee (BPSK) Example

### Bluetooth Example

### WiFi IEEE 802.11a/g/n

Uses OFDM with various QAM levels for high data rates.


### MIMO

High-level: Enhances spectral efficiency and reliability by using multiple antennas.

### Spatial Multiplexing

High-level: Transmits independent data streams over multiple antennas to increase data rates.

### MIMO Detection

### MMSE

### Eigen Beam-Forming
