    fork
      //Process-1
      begin

      end

      //Process-2
      begin
        $display($time,"\tProcess-2 Started");
        #20;
        $display($time,"\tProcess-2 Finished");
      end

      //Process-3
      begin

Types of fork joins:

- fork join - Finishes when all child threads are over
- fork join_any - Finishes when any child thread gets over
- fork join_none - Finishes soon after child threads are spawned
