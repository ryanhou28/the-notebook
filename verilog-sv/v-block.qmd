# Verilog - Building Blocks

## Modules


## Assign

## Operators

```verilog
// Arithmetic Operators
a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
a % b
a ** b

// Relational Operators

// Equality Operators
a === b	// a equal to b, including x and z
a !== b	// a not equal to b, including x and z
a == b	// a equal to b, result can be unknown
a != b	// a not equal to b, result can be unknown

// Logical Operators


// Bitwise


// Shift
```

Concatenation

Replication

Sign extension

## Always Block

## Initial Block

There are mainly two types of procedural blocks in Verilog - initial and always

initial block is not synthesizable
