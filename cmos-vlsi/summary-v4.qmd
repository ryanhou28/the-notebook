Capacitor Energy: $E=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$

Capacitor: $I = C \frac{dV}{dt}$

Inductor Voltage: $V=L\frac{dI}{dt}$

RC Circuit Charging: $V_C(t) = V_{DD}(1-e^{-t/RC})$

RC Circuit Discharging: $V_C(t) = V_0 e^{-t/RC}$, initial voltage $V_0$

RL Current Growth (applying VDD): $I(t) = \frac{V_{DD}}{R}(1-e^{-Rt/L})$

RL Current Decay (remove supply): $I(t)=I_0 e^{-Rt/L}$


**Diffusion** - movement of charge carriers move from regions of high concentration to low concentration

**Drift** - movement of charge carriers due to external electric field

**Depletion Region** - region where mobile charge carriers are depleted

**Inversion** - mode of operation where formation of conductive channel opposite to substrate type

## CMOS Basics

Why is PMOS "slower"?

- electrons have higher mobility than holes
- due to this lower carrier mobility, PMOS is weaker to charge (load) capacitance 

Why is PMOS sized ~2x NMOS?

- due to lower mobility of charge carrier, need to size larger (W) to match drive strength of NMOS

### Regions of Operation

- **Cutoff Region**
  - $V_{GS} < V_{TH}$
- **Linear Region**
  - $V_{GS} > V_{TH}$ and $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH}$
- **Saturation Region**
  - $V_{GS} > V_{TH}$ and $V_{DS} \geq V_{GS} - V_{TH}$
  - Channel is pinched off (on drain end). Current mostly controlled by $V_{GS}$
    - Depletion region forms on drain end
  - Essentially current starts to plateau the more it saturates

### Propagation Delay

$t_{p} = 0.69 R_{ON} C_L$, where R_ON is the resistance of NMOS/PMOS (whichever is ON)

$$t_p = 0.69 R_W C_{int} (1 + C_L / C_{int})$$

### Long vs Short Channel

![](images/summary/longshort-iv3.png)

IV characteristic is quadratic for long channel, linear for short channel

Velocity saturation in short channel, thus current becomes linearly dependent on $V_{GS}$ in saturation

**Transient Response:** $t_p = 0.69R_{on}C_L$

### Speedup

- Reduce capacitance
- Increase transistor size
- Increase VDD

## Capacitance

- Parasitic capacitance of MOS transistor
  - $C_{GS}$: overlap, gate-to-channel (linear, saturation/velocity sat)
  - $C_{GD}$: overlap, gate-to-channel (linear)
  - $C_{GB}$: gate-to-channel (cutoff)
  - $C_{SB}$: bottom plate, side wall
  - $C_{DB}$: bottom plate, side wall, reverse-bias effect
- All the caps involving the gate are gate capacitances. The rest are junction (diffusion) capacitance

$C_{GC}=C_{OX}WL$

## Leakage

- Subthreshold Leakage
- Gate Leakage (tunneling through oxide)
- Junction Leakage (from PN junction)

## Power

**Components:**

- Dynamic:
  - Power due to switching, i.e. charging and discharging capacitances through device
- Short-circuit (can also be categorized as static)
  - Direct path between VDD and ground during switching transients (when both PUN PDN are partially on)
- Static
  - Leakage current consuming power when not switching

**Inverter Power Derivation:**

- Input 1->0 (Output 0->1)
- Input 0->1

### Dynamic

Energy / Transition = $C_L V_{DD}^2$

Power = Energy / Transition * freq = $C_L V_{DD}^2 f_{clk}$

Avg Power = $\alpha C_L V_{DD}^2 f_{clk}$

## Logic Families

Static CMOS:

- Full rail to rail swing, high noise margins
- Low static power dissipation

Dynamic Logic:

- Faster
- Needs pre-charging (two phases)
- no rail to rail swing
  - need static cmos to restore levels
- higher power

## IR Drop

Voltage drop across a resistance R with current I, in power grids (long metal lines with branches)

## Charge Sharing

Charge stored in load capacitance could be redistributed in dynamic logic. Solution is to precharge internal nodes using clock-driven transistor

## Power Gating / Power Domain Crossing

- Problems that might occur:
  - Voltage level mismatch, signal integrity, timing errors
- Solutions:
  - Level shifter: convert signal voltages between domains
  - Isolation cells: Prevent leakage between domains, isolates power gated logic from always-on logic
  - Synchronizers: ensure proper timing when crossing domains
  - Switch Cell: Header or Footer switch cell, gates the VDD and VSS rails
  - Retention Cell: retains state when primary power supply is OFF, can restore state/

## Interconnects

- Lower layers - smaller cross-sectional area, higher resistance and capacitance per unit length - local interconnects
- Higher layers - wider and thicker traces, lower resistance and cap - global routing & power distribution

$$R = \frac{\rho L}{HW}$$

## Temperature

- Leakage: increases with temperature (increased subthreshold conduction)
- Dynamic: less sensitive with temperature


## Low Power Techniques

- Reduce capacitance
  - Sizing, P/N ratio, shorte routes
- Reduce switching activity
  - Clock gating
  - More efficient codes (gray codes)
- Lower VDD
  - DVFS
- Pipelining
