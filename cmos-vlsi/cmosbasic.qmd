### Silicon Lattice

**Silicon (Si)**

- semiconductor, forms basic starting material
- A Group IV element -> forms covalent bonds with 4 adjacent atoms
  - with **pure silicon**, all valence electrons are in chemical bonds, thus a **poor conductor**
- Raise conductivity adding **dopants** into the lattice (adding impurities)
- Dopant from Group V (e.g. arsenic As) has 5 valence electrons
  - Replacing one silicon atom leads to the lattice having 4 bonds but 1 valence electron loosely bound (b in fig. below)
  - Free electron can carry current thus raising conductivity
  - This is an **n-type** semiconductor
    - Free **carriers** are **negatively charged electrons**
- Dopant from Group III (e.g. boron B) has 3 valence electrons
  - Similarly, boron atom can borrow electron from neighboring Si which is now short by one electron
    - This creates a **hole** (a missing electron)
    - hole acts as positive carrier
  - This is a **p-type** semiconductor (c in fig. below)

### PN Junction

Junction between p-type (anode) and n-type (cathode) is a **diode**

- Voltage on p-type > n-type: diode is **forward biased** and current flows
- Otherwise (p-type $\leq$ n-type): diode is **reverse biased**, very little current flows

- charge transfer (of electrons and holes) across the junction is called **diffusion**
- free electrons in the anode fills up some holes in the cathode
- this forms a **depletion layer**
  - depletion layer is depleted of any free carriers (electrons or holes)
    - in comparison on the n- and p-regions there are still free carriers
  - acts as a barrier to further current flow
- When applying **forward bias** (anode has higher voltage)
  - Positive voltage on p-type pushes holes towards junction
  - Negative voltage on n-type pushes electrons towards junction
  - Shrinks depletion region
    - Once voltage is high enough, depletion region becomes so thin that electrons can freely pass (current flow)
- When applying **reverse bias** (anode has lower voltage)
  - Negative voltage on p-type pulls holes away from junction
  - Positive voltage on n-type pulls electrons away from junction
  - Makes depletion region wider
    - Creates stronger barrier to current flow

Analogy: A hill between two valleys. Forward bias reduces height of the hill, making it easy for charges to cross the hill. Reverse bias makes the hill taller, making it more difficult.

**Why does the depletion region create a barrier? Why don't more electrons cross into p-type to fill up holes?**

- When an electron fills a hole in the p-type
  - leaves behind positive ion on n-type (an atom lost its extra electron)
  - leaves behind a negative ion on the p-type (an atom has an extra electron)
- Thus depletion region becomes filled with positive ions on n-type side and negative ions on p-type side
  - Recall that ions are charged particles - (i.e. has more electrons than protons, or more protons than electrons)
- **Ions create an electric field**
  - (+) ions in the n-side and (-) ions in the p-side create an electric field pointing from n to p
    - electric field opposes the further flow of electrons
    - Think of like building static electricity: more charge separates, the stronger the opposing force becomes
