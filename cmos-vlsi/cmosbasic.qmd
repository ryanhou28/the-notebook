## MOS Transistor Basics


### Silicon Lattice

**Silicon (Si)**

- semiconductor, forms basic starting material
- A Group IV element -> forms covalent bonds with 4 adjacent atoms
  - with **pure silicon**, all valence electrons are in chemical bonds, thus a **poor conductor**
- Raise conductivity adding **dopants** into the lattice (adding impurities)
- Dopant from Group V (e.g. arsenic As) has 5 valence electrons
  - Replacing one silicon atom leads to the lattice having 4 bonds but 1 valence electron loosely bound (b in fig. below)
  - Free electron can carry current thus raising conductivity
  - This is an **n-type** semiconductor
    - Free **carriers** are **negatively charged electrons**
- Dopant from Group III (e.g. boron B) has 3 valence electrons
  - Similarly, boron atom can borrow electron from neighboring Si which is now short by one electron
    - This creates a **hole** (a missing electron)
    - hole acts as positive carrier
  - This is a **p-type** semiconductor (c in fig. below)
- Note that when current flows, electrons and holes move in **opposite directions**
  - Recall how electrons move opposite to direction of conventional current flow
    - Holes move in same direction as conventional current flow
    - in semiconductors, current can be carried by holes as well because both electrons and holes are primary charge carriers
      - This goes into band structure of semiconductors:
      - Electrons occupy two main energy bands: **valence band** (lower energy) and **conduction band** (higher)
      - When an electron gains enoug energy (eg through doping) it moves from valence to conduction band, leaving a hole in valence band
      - p-type doping creates deficit of electrons in valence band (creating holes)

### PN Junction

![PN Junction. Source: [@cmosvlsi]](images/cmosbasic/pn.png){#fig-label fig-align="center" width="40%"}

Junction between p-type (anode) and n-type (cathode) is a **diode**

- Voltage on p-type > n-type: diode is **forward biased** and current flows
- Otherwise (p-type $\leq$ n-type): diode is **reverse biased**, very little current flows

![[Source](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/us/semiconductor/knowledge/e-learning/discrete/chap1/chap1-6.html)](images/cmosbasic/pn-dep.png)

- charge transfer (of electrons and holes) across the junction is called **diffusion**
- free electrons in the anode fills up some holes in the cathode
- this forms a **depletion layer**
  - depletion layer is depleted of any free carriers (electrons or holes)
    - in comparison on the n- and p-regions there are still free carriers
  - acts as a barrier to further current flow
- When applying **forward bias** (anode has higher voltage)
  - Positive voltage on p-type pushes holes towards junction
  - Negative voltage on n-type pushes electrons towards junction (where negative ions are repelling )
  - Shrinks depletion region
    - Once voltage is high enough, depletion region becomes so thin that electrons can freely pass (current flow)
- When applying **reverse bias** (anode has lower voltage)
  - Negative voltage on p-type pulls holes away from junction
  - Positive voltage on n-type pulls electrons away from junction
  - Makes depletion region wider
    - Creates stronger barrier to current flow

Analogy: A hill between two valleys. Forward bias reduces height of the hill, making it easy for charges to cross the hill. Reverse bias makes the hill taller, making it more difficult.

**Why does the depletion region create a barrier? Why don't more electrons cross into p-type to fill up holes?**

- When an electron fills a hole in the p-type
  - leaves behind positive ion on n-type (an atom lost its extra electron)
  - leaves behind a negative ion on the p-type (an atom has an extra electron)
- Thus depletion region becomes filled with positive ions on n-type side and negative ions on p-type side
  - Recall that ions are charged particles - (i.e. has more electrons than protons, or more protons than electrons)
- **Ions create an electric field**
  - (+) ions in the n-side and (-) ions in the p-side create an electric field pointing from n to p
    - electric field opposes the further flow of electrons
    - Think of like building static electricity: more charge separates, the stronger the opposing force becomes

### Transistor Structure


Terminology clarifications:

- Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) - refers to the structure used in MOSFETs (ie consisting of the M, O, and S)
- Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) - the actual type of FET that uses MOS structure for a transistor
- Field-Effect Transistors (FET) - superset of MOSFET - transistors that control current using an electric field
  - Voltage-controlled device
  - Sometimes used interchangeably with MOSFET
- Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) - refers to the technology that use both NMOS and PMOS (complementary)
  - Why CMOS?
    - In steady-state, only one type of transistor (N or PMOS) conducts
      - Thus no direct current path from supply to ground, leading to lower static power
      - i.e. power mainly comes from switching (although see further notes on static power)
    - Full rail-to-rail swing (0 to VDD) - good logic level separation
  - E.g. compared to pure NMOS logic, CMOS has lower static power dissipation and full voltage swing (but slower)

FET because transistor operation is controlled by electric fields (thus the *field effect* transistor)

CMOS technology provides two types of transistors/devices: **n-type transistor (nMOS)**, and **p-type transistor (pMOS)**

MOS Structure:

- **gate** - conducting gate
  - Early transistors: metal gates
  - 1970s and on: **polysilicon** (polycrystalline silicon)
  - metal gates have reemerged in '07
- **silicon dioxide** (SiO_2, glass)
  - Essentially works as the dialectric (insulator) between gate and semiconductor
- **substrate/body/bulk** - the silicon wafer

- NMOS is built with p-type body, with n-type semiconductor adjacent to the gate. These regions are the **source** and the **drain**. The body is typically grounded.
  - PMOS is opposite
- The substrate is either n-type or p-type, with the other flavor of transistor built in a special **well** to form the body of the opposite type
- **gate** is the control input - affecting flow of electrical current between source and drain

![NMOS Operations. [Source](https://www.mks.com/n/mosfet-physics)](images/cmosbasic/nmos-op-crosssec.png)

NMOS:

- body is grounded (pn junction of source and drain to body is reverse-biased)
  - If gate is also grounded, no current can flow through the junctions since they are reverse-biased
    - Thus transistor is OFF
  - As gate voltage is raised, gate creates electric field that attracts free electrons 
    - Why does raising gate voltage attract free electrons?
      - MOS structure essentially creates a parallel-plate capacitor (gate as a plate, and silicon beneath SiO_2 as a plate)
      - Gate voltage (potential difference) between the two plates create an electric field
      - Since SiO_2 is an insulator, charge cannot flow through it, thus inducing charge redistribution in the semiconductor
      - Positive gate voltage -> "capacitor" of gate and substrate forms electric field pointing downwards, pulling electrons upwards (positive potential of gate attracts them)
  - Once voltage is raised enough, electrons outnumber holes and creates a **channel**
    - **channel** is the thin region under the gate that becomes inverted to act as an n-type semiconductor
      - allowing conducting path of electron flow between source and drain
      - Thus transistor is ON

PMOS:

- Situation is opposite: body is at positive voltage
  - When gate is at positive voltage, source and drain junctions are reverse-biased -> no current flow
  - At lowered gate voltage, positive charges attracted towards the bottom of the SiO_2
    - Low enough gate voltage inverts the channel creating a conducting path for positive carriers from source to drain


- High voltage (Logic level 1) usually denoted $V_{DD}$ or POWER
  - VDD for Voltage Drain Drain
- Low voltage (Logic level 0) called GROUND (GND) or denoted as $V_{SS}$
  - VSS for Voltage Source Source
- This allows MOSFETs to be viewed as ON/OFF switches

- The MOS transistor is a **majority-carrier** device - gate voltage controls current in a conducting channel between source and drain
  - NMOS: majority carriers are electrons
  - PMOS: majority carriers are holes
- Note that the source terminal sources the majority carrier which go to the drain
  - i.e. for nmos electrons go from source to drain, for pmos holes go

### Very Simplified Model

The following demonstrates a very simplified MOS without the source and drain:

![Source:[@cmosvlsi]](images/cmosbasic/simplified.png)

- a) negative voltage on gate - holes attracted to region beneath the gate
- b) small positive voltage on gate - some positive charge on the gate, repelling the like holes below the gate
  - **depletion** region - region in the body where holes are repelled away
- c) higher positive potential larger than a threshold voltage $V_t$ on gate - attracks a lot of positive charge to the gate, further repelling the holes and some free electrons in the body are attracted to the region beneath the gate
  - **inversion** layer - the conductive layer of electrons in the p-type body

Now let us examine an NMOS:

![NMOS Regions of Operation: a) Cutoff region b, c) Linear region d) Saturation region Source:[@cmosvlsi]](images/cmosbasic/nmos-regions.png)

**Cutoff Region**:

- $V_{gs} < V_t$
- Source and drain have free electrons, body has free holes but no free electrons
  - junction between body and source/drain are zero/reverse-biased, so little to no current flow
  - OFF
- 

**Linear Region**:

- aka resistive, triode, nonsaturated, unsaturated, ohmic
- $V_{gs} > V_t$
  - but $0 < V_{ds} < V_{gs} - V_t$
- Inversion region of majority carriers (in this case electrons) - named the **channel** - creates a conductive path betwen source and drain
- ON
- Number of carriers and conductivity increases with gate voltage
- **Potential difference between drain and source**: $V_{ds}=V_{gs}-V_{gd}$
  - if $V_{ds}$ is 0, no eletric field to push current from drain to source
- When small positive $V_{ds}$ - current $I_{ds}$ flows from drain to source
  - The current increases with both $V_{ds}$ and $V_{gs}$

**Saturation Region**:

- $V_{ds}$ is so large that $V_{gd} < V_{t}$
- channel is no longer inverted and is **pinched off**

Analogy: water valve

- Gate is the valve of a water pipe
