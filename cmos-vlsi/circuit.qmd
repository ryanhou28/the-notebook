## Charge, Voltage, Current, Power

### Charge (Q)
Electric charge is measured in Coulombs (C). The fundamental unit of charge is the electron charge:

$$Q_e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

The movement of charge carriers (typically electrons in circuits) creates current.

### Voltage (V)
Voltage is the electric potential difference between two points, measured in Volts (V). Key equations:

$$V = IR \text{ (Ohm's Law)}$$

$$V = \frac{dW}{dQ} \text{ (Work per unit charge)}$$

### Current (I)
Current is the rate of charge flow, measured in Amperes (A):

$$I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$

For sinusoidal signals:
$$I = I_0\sin(\omega t)$$

### Power (P)
Power is the rate of energy transfer, measured in Watts (W):

$$P = VI \text{ (instantaneous)}$$
$$P = I^2R \text{ (resistive loss)}$$
$$P = CV^2f \text{ (dynamic CMOS)}$$
$$P_{avg} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T p(t)dt \text{ (average)}$$

## Resistance, Capacitance, Inductance

### Resistance (R)

Resistance is the property of a material that opposes the flow of electric current, resulting in the conversion of electrical energy to thermal energy.

Key equations:

$$V = IR \text{ (Ohm's Law)}$$
$$P = I^2R \text{ (power dissipation)}$$
$$R = \rho\frac{L}{A} \text{ (bulk resistance)}$$

where:

- $\rho$ is resistivity
- $L$ is length
- $A$ is cross-sectional area

### Capacitance (C)

Capacitance (measured in Farads F) is the ability of a component to store electric charge, measured as the ratio of stored charge to the applied voltage. Key equations:

$$Q = CV \text{ (charge stored)}$$
$$I_C = C\frac{dV}{dt} \text{ (capacitor current)}$$
$$\tau = RC \text{ (time constant)}$$

For parallel plate capacitors:
$$C = \frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_r A}{d}$$

where:
- $A$ is plate area
- $d$ is plate separation
- $\epsilon_0$ is permittivity of free space
- $\epsilon_r$ is relative permittivity

### Inductance (L)
Inductance (measured in Henries H) is the property of a circuit element to oppose changes in current flow by storing energy in a magnetic field:

$$V_L = L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
$$\tau_L = \frac{L}{R} \text{ (inductive time constant)}$$
$$E = \frac{1}{2}LI^2 \text{ (stored energy)}$$

## Electric Fields

An electric field is a region of space surrounding a charged particle where another charged particle would experience a force, essentially acting like an invisible "push" or "pull" depending on the charges involved. It is the **force per unit charge** experienced by a small positive test charge placed at that point. Units: $V/m$ or $N/C$

$$E = \frac{F}{q}$$

- 
- electric field is the rate of change of voltage w.r.t. position
- strong electric field -> rapid change in voltage over short distance
- In circuits, voltage sources create electric fields that drive current flow

## KVL & KCL

### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
The sum of voltages around any closed loop equals zero:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n V_k = 0$$

### Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)
The sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving it:

$$\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$$
$$\sum_{k=1}^n I_k = 0 \text{ (node equation)}$$

## Basic Circuit Configurations

### Series Connections

In series connections, components share the same current:
$$I_{total} = I_1 = I_2 = ... = I_n$$
For components in series:

- Resistors: $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n$
- Capacitors: $\frac{1}{C_{total}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + ... + \frac{1}{C_n}$
- Inductors: $L_{total} = L_1 + L_2 + ... + L_n$
- Voltage Division: $V_i = V_{total}\frac{R_i}{R_{total}}$

### Parallel Connections

In parallel connections, components share the same voltage:
$$V_{total} = V_1 = V_2 = ... = V_n$$

For components in parallel:

- Resistors: $\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}$
- Capacitors: $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n$
- Inductors: $\frac{1}{L_{total}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + ... + \frac{1}{L_n}$
- Current Division: $I_i = I_{total}\frac{R_{total}}{R_i}$

## Capacitor

A capacitor stores eletrical energy in an electric field created between two conductive plates separated by an insulator (dialectric)

- When a voltage is applied, electrons build up on one plate (creating negative charge), and the other plate loses electrons (resulting in positive charge)
-

## PN Junctions

The PN junction is fundamental to semiconductor devices and CMOS operation. Key concepts and equations:

### Built-in Potential

The built-in potential ($V_{bi}$) across the junction at equilibrium:

$V_{bi} = V_T \ln(\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2})$

where:

- $N_A$ is acceptor concentration in p-region
- $N_D$ is donor concentration in n-region
- $n_i$ is intrinsic carrier concentration
- $V_T$ is thermal voltage ($k_BT/q$)

### Depletion Region

$W = \sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_s}{q}(\frac{N_A + N_D}{N_A N_D})(V_{bi} - V_A)}$

where:

- $V_A$ is the applied voltage
- $\epsilon_s$ is semiconductor permittivity
- $q$ is elementary charge

### Current-Voltage Relationship

$I_D = I_S(e^{V_D/V_T} - 1)$

where:

- $I_S$ is the reverse saturation current
- $V_D$ is the diode voltage
- $V_T$ is thermal voltage

The saturation current:

$I_S = qA(\frac{D_p}{L_p}p_n + \frac{D_n}{L_n}n_p)$

where:

- $D_p, D_n$ are diffusion coefficients
- $L_p, L_n$ are diffusion lengths
- $A$ is junction area

### Junction Capacitance

The junction capacitance has two components:

**Depletion capacitance:**

$C_j = \frac{C_{j0}}{\sqrt{1 - V_D/V_{bi}}}$

**Diffusion capacitance:**

$C_d = \tau_T\frac{dI_D}{dV_D} = \tau_T\frac{I_D + I_S}{V_T}$

where:

- $C_{j0}$ is zero-bias junction capacitance
- $\tau_T$ is transit time

### Temperature Effects

Temperature dependence of key parameters:

$I_S(T) \propto T^3e^{-E_g/k_BT}$

$V_{bi}(T) = V_{bi}(T_0) - \beta(T-T_0)$

where $\beta$ is the temperature coefficient.
