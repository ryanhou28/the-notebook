## Charge, Voltage, Current, Power

### Charge (Q)
Electric charge is measured in Coulombs (C). The fundamental unit of charge is the electron charge:

$$Q_e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$$

The movement of charge carriers (typically electrons in circuits) creates current.

### Voltage (V)
Voltage is the electric potential difference between two points, measured in Volts (V). Key equations:

$$V = IR \text{ (Ohm's Law)}$$

$$V = \frac{dW}{dQ} \text{ (Work per unit charge)}$$

### Current (I)
Current is the rate of charge flow, measured in Amperes (A):

$$I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$

For sinusoidal signals:
$$I = I_0\sin(\omega t)$$

### Power (P)
Power is the rate of energy transfer, measured in Watts (W):

$$P = VI \text{ (instantaneous)}$$
$$P = I^2R \text{ (resistive loss)}$$
$$P = CV^2f \text{ (dynamic CMOS)}$$
$$P_{avg} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T p(t)dt \text{ (average)}$$

## Capacitance, Inductance

### Capacitance (C)
Capacitance is measured in Farads (F). Key equations:

$$Q = CV \text{ (charge stored)}$$
$$I_C = C\frac{dV}{dt} \text{ (capacitor current)}$$
$$\tau = RC \text{ (time constant)}$$

For parallel plate capacitors:
$$C = \frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon_r A}{d}$$

where:
- $A$ is plate area
- $d$ is plate separation
- $\epsilon_0$ is permittivity of free space
- $\epsilon_r$ is relative permittivity

### Inductance (L)
Inductance is measured in Henries (H):

$$V_L = L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
$$\tau_L = \frac{L}{R} \text{ (inductive time constant)}$$
$$E = \frac{1}{2}LI^2 \text{ (stored energy)}$$

## KVL & KCL

### Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
The sum of voltages around any closed loop equals zero:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n V_k = 0$$

### Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)
The sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving it:

$$\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$$
$$\sum_{k=1}^n I_k = 0 \text{ (node equation)}$$

## Additional Topics Relevant to CMOS/VLSI

### Small Signal Analysis
Key parameters and equations:

$$g_m = \frac{\partial I_D}{\partial V_{GS}} \text{ (transconductance)}$$
$$r_o = \frac{\partial V_{DS}}{\partial I_D} \text{ (output resistance)}$$
$$A_v = -g_m r_o \text{ (small-signal gain)}$$

### RC Networks
Time domain analysis:

$$v(t) = V(1-e^{-t/RC}) \text{ (charging)}$$
$$v(t) = Ve^{-t/RC} \text{ (discharging)}$$
$$t_p \approx 0.69RC \text{ (propagation delay)}$$

### Noise and Signal Integrity
Thermal noise power spectral density:
$$S_v(f) = 4k_BTR \text{ (V²/Hz)}$$

Shot noise current spectral density:
$$S_i(f) = 2qI_D \text{ (A²/Hz)}$$

Signal-to-Noise Ratio:
$$SNR = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \frac{V_{signal,rms}^2}{V_{noise,rms}^2}$$

### Semiconductor Physics Basics
Carrier concentration:
$$n_i^2 = N_C N_V e^{-E_g/k_BT}$$

Built-in potential:
$$V_{bi} = V_T \ln(\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2})$$

MOSFET threshold voltage:
$$V_{th} = V_{FB} + 2\phi_F + \frac{\sqrt{2\epsilon_s q N_A (2\phi_F)}}{C_{ox}}$$

where:

- $V_{FB}$ is the flatband voltage
- $\phi_F$ is the Fermi potential
- $N_A$ is acceptor concentration
- $C_{ox}$ is oxide capacitance per unit area


## PN Junctions

The PN junction is fundamental to semiconductor devices and CMOS operation. Key concepts and equations:

### Built-in Potential

The built-in potential ($V_{bi}$) across the junction at equilibrium:

$V_{bi} = V_T \ln(\frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2})$

where:

- $N_A$ is acceptor concentration in p-region
- $N_D$ is donor concentration in n-region
- $n_i$ is intrinsic carrier concentration
- $V_T$ is thermal voltage ($k_BT/q$)

### Depletion Region

The depletion width ($W$) under bias:

$W = \sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon_s}{q}(\frac{N_A + N_D}{N_A N_D})(V_{bi} - V_A)}$

where:

- $V_A$ is the applied voltage
- $\epsilon_s$ is semiconductor permittivity
- $q$ is elementary charge

### Current-Voltage Relationship

The ideal diode equation:

$I_D = I_S(e^{V_D/V_T} - 1)$

where:

- $I_S$ is the reverse saturation current
- $V_D$ is the diode voltage
- $V_T$ is thermal voltage

The saturation current:

$I_S = qA(\frac{D_p}{L_p}p_n + \frac{D_n}{L_n}n_p)$

where:

- $D_p, D_n$ are diffusion coefficients
- $L_p, L_n$ are diffusion lengths
- $A$ is junction area

### Junction Capacitance

The junction capacitance has two components:

**Depletion capacitance:**

$C_j = \frac{C_{j0}}{\sqrt{1 - V_D/V_{bi}}}$

**Diffusion capacitance:**

$C_d = \tau_T\frac{dI_D}{dV_D} = \tau_T\frac{I_D + I_S}{V_T}$

where:

- $C_{j0}$ is zero-bias junction capacitance
- $\tau_T$ is transit time

### Temperature Effects

Temperature dependence of key parameters:

$I_S(T) \propto T^3e^{-E_g/k_BT}$

$V_{bi}(T) = V_{bi}(T_0) - \beta(T-T_0)$

where $\beta$ is the temperature coefficient.

## Note on Temperature Dependencies
Many parameters in CMOS circuits have significant temperature dependencies. Key relationships include:

- Mobility: $\mu(T) \propto T^{-3/2}$
- Threshold voltage: $V_{th}(T) = V_{th}(T_0) + \alpha(T-T_0)$
- Leakage current: $I_{leak} \propto T^2e^{-E_g/2k_BT}$
