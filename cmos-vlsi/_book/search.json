Source: (Weste and Harris 2010)\n\n\n\nJunction between p-type (anode) and n-type (cathode) is a diode\n\nVoltage on p-type &gt; n-type: diode is forward biased and current flows\nOtherwise (p-type \\(\\leq\\) n-type): diode is reverse biased, very little current flows\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\n\ncharge transfer (of electrons and holes) across the junction is called diffusion\nfree electrons in the anode fills up some holes in the cathode\nthis forms a depletion layer\n\ndepletion layer is depleted of any free carriers (electrons or holes)\n\nin comparison on the n- and p-regions there are still free carriers\n\nacts as a barrier to further current flow\n\nWhen applying forward bias (anode has higher voltage)\n\nPositive voltage on p-type pushes holes towards junction\nNegative voltage on n-type pushes electrons towards junction (where negative ions are repelling )\nShrinks depletion region\n\nOnce voltage is high enough, depletion region becomes so thin that electrons can freely pass (current flow)\n\n\nWhen applying reverse bias (anode has lower voltage)\n\nNegative voltage on p-type pulls holes away from junction\nPositive voltage on n-type pulls electrons away from junction\nMakes depletion region wider\n\nCreates stronger barrier to current flow\n\n\n\nAnalogy: A hill between two valleys. Forward bias reduces height of the hill, making it easy for charges to cross the hill. Reverse bias makes the hill taller, making it more difficult.\nWhy does the depletion region create a barrier? Why don’t more electrons cross into p-type to fill up holes?\n\nWhen an electron fills a hole in the p-type\n\nleaves behind positive ion on n-type (an atom lost its extra electron)\nleaves behind a negative ion on the p-type (an atom has an extra electron)\n\nThus depletion region becomes filled with positive ions on n-type side and negative ions on p-type side\n\nRecall that ions are charged particles - (i.e. has more electrons than protons, or more protons than electrons)\n\nIons create an electric field\n\n(+) ions in the n-side and (-) ions in the p-side create an electric field pointing from n to p\n\nelectric field opposes the further flow of electrons\nThink of like building static electricity: more charge separates, the stronger the opposing force becomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Source\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Transistor Structure\nTerminology clarifications:\n\nMetal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) - refers to the structure used in MOSFETs (ie consisting of the M, O, and S)\nMetal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) - the actual type of FET that uses MOS structure for a transistor\nField-Effect Transistors (FET) - superset of MOSFET - transistors that control current using an electric field\n\nVoltage-controlled device\nSometimes used interchangeably with MOSFET\n\nComplementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) - refers to the technology that use both NMOS and PMOS (complementary)\n\nWhy CMOS?\n\nIn steady-state, only one type of transistor (N or PMOS) conducts\n\nThus no direct current path from supply to ground, leading to lower static power\ni.e. power mainly comes from switching (although see further notes on static power)\n\nFull rail-to-rail swing (0 to VDD) - good logic level separation\n\nE.g. compared to pure NMOS logic, CMOS has lower static power dissipation and full voltage swing (but slower)\n\n\nFET because transistor operation is controlled by electric fields (thus the field effect transistor)\n\n\n\nCross-sections of a) nMOS, and b) pMOS. n+/p+ regions are heavily doped. Source: (Weste and Harris 2010)\n\n\nCMOS technology provides two types of transistors/devices: n-type transistor (nMOS), and p-type transistor (pMOS)\nMOS Structure:\n\ngate - conducting gate\n\nEarly transistors: metal gates\n1970s and on: polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon)\nmetal gates have reemerged in ’07\n\nsilicon dioxide (SiO_2, glass)\n\nEssentially works as the dialectric (insulator) between gate and semiconductor\n\nsubstrate/body/bulk - the silicon wafer\nNMOS is built with p-type body, with n-type semiconductor adjacent to the gate. These regions are the source and the drain. The body is typically grounded.\n\nPMOS is opposite\n\nThe substrate is either n-type or p-type, with the other flavor of transistor built in a special well to form the body of the opposite type\ngate is the control input - affecting flow of electrical current between source and drain\n\n\n\n\nNMOS Operations. Source\n\n\nNMOS:\n\nbody is grounded (pn junction of source and drain to body is reverse-biased)\n\nIf gate is also grounded, no current can flow through the junctions since they are reverse-biased\n\nThus transistor is OFF\n\nAs gate voltage is raised, gate creates electric field that attracts free electrons\n\nWhy does raising gate voltage attract free electrons?\n\nMOS structure essentially creates a parallel-plate capacitor (gate as a plate, and silicon beneath SiO_2 as a plate)\nGate voltage (potential difference) between the two plates create an electric field\nSince SiO_2 is an insulator, charge cannot flow through it, thus inducing charge redistribution in the semiconductor\nPositive gate voltage -&gt; “capacitor” of gate and substrate forms electric field pointing downwards, pulling electrons upwards (positive potential of gate attracts them)\n\n\nOnce voltage is raised enough, electrons outnumber holes and creates a channel\n\nchannel is the thin region under the gate that becomes inverted to act as an n-type semiconductor\n\nallowing conducting path of electron flow between source and drain\nThus transistor is ON\n\n\n\n\nPMOS:\n\nSituation is opposite: body is at positive voltage\n\nWhen gate is at positive voltage, source and drain junctions are reverse-biased -&gt; no current flow\nAt lowered gate voltage, positive charges attracted towards the bottom of the SiO_2\n\nLow enough gate voltage inverts the channel creating a conducting path for positive carriers from source to drain\n\n\nHigh voltage (Logic level 1) usually denoted \\(V_{DD}\\) or POWER\n\nVDD for Voltage Drain Drain\n\nLow voltage (Logic level 0) called GROUND (GND) or denoted as \\(V_{SS}\\)\n\nVSS for Voltage Source Source\n\nThis allows MOSFETs to be viewed as ON/OFF switches\n\n \n\nThe MOS transistor is a majority-carrier device - gate voltage controls current in a conducting channel between source and drain\n\nNMOS: majority carriers are electrons\nPMOS: majority carriers are holes\n\nNote that the source terminal sources the majority carrier which go to the drain\n\ni.e. for nmos electrons go from source to drain, for pmos holes go\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Very Simplified Model\nThe following demonstrates a very simplified MOS without the source and drain:\n\n\n\nSource:(Weste and Harris 2010)\n\n\n\n\nnegative voltage on gate - holes attracted to region beneath the gate\n\n\nsmall positive voltage on gate - some positive charge on the gate, repelling the like holes below the gate\n\n\ndepletion region - region in the body where holes are repelled away\n\n\nhigher positive potential larger than a threshold voltage \\(V_t\\) on gate - attracks a lot of positive charge to the gate, further repelling the holes and some free electrons in the body are attracted to the region beneath the gate\n\n\ninversion layer - the conductive layer of electrons in the p-type body\n\n\nNow let us examine an NMOS:\n\n\n\nNMOS Regions of Operation: a) Cutoff region b, c) Linear region d) Saturation region Source:(Weste and Harris 2010)\n\n\nCutoff Region:\n\n\\(V_{gs} &lt; V_t\\)\nSource and drain have free electrons, body has free holes but no free electrons\n\njunction between body and source/drain are zero/reverse-biased, so little to no current flow\nOFF\n\n\n\nLinear Region:\n\naka resistive, triode, nonsaturated, unsaturated, ohmic\n\\(V_{gs} &gt; V_t\\)\n\nbut \\(0 &lt; V_{ds} &lt; V_{gs} - V_t\\)\n\nInversion region of majority carriers (in this case electrons) - named the channel - creates a conductive path betwen source and drain\nON\nNumber of carriers and conductivity increases with gate voltage\nPotential difference between drain and source: \\(V_{ds}=V_{gs}-V_{gd}\\)\n\nif \\(V_{ds}\\) is 0, no eletric field to push current from drain to source\n\nWhen small positive \\(V_{ds}\\) - current \\(I_{ds}\\) flows from drain to source\n\nThe current increases with both \\(V_{ds}\\) and \\(V_{gs}\\)\n\n\nSaturation Region:\n\n\\(V_{ds}\\) is so large that \\(V_{gd} &lt; V_{t}\\)\nchannel is no longer inverted and is pinched off\n\nAnalogy: water valve\n\nGate is the valve of a water pipe",
