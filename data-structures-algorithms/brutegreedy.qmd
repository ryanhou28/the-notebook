## Greedy Algorithms

Definition: At every decision step, makes the locally optimal decision.

To guarantee correctness/optimality, must show that locally optimal solutions lead to globally optimal solution


## Summary

Brute-force

- Solve problem in simplest way
- Generate entire solution set, pick best
- Will give optimal solution with (typically) poor efficiency

Greedy

- Make local, best decision, and don’t look back
- May give optimal solution with (typically) ‘better’
efficiency
- Depends upon ‘greedy-choice property’
- Global optimum found by series of local optimum choices
