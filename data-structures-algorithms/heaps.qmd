## Heap? Priority Queue?

Priority Queue is an **Abstract Data Type**, and Heap is the concrete data structure we use to implement a priority queue. [Source](https://algo.monster/problems/heap_intro)



Definition: A tree is (max) heap-ordered if each node’s priority is not greater than the priority of the node’s parent

Definition: A heap is a set of nodes with keys arranged in a complete heap-ordered tree, represented as an array

Property: No node in a heap has a key larger than the root’s key

A heap has two crucial properties (representation invariants):

1. Completeness
2. Heap-ordering

These two properties can be leveraged to create an efficient priority queue and an efficient sorting algorithm using a heap!

Loose definition: data structure that gives easy access to the most extreme element, e.g., maximum or minimum

“Max Heap”: heap with largest element being the “most extreme”

“Min Heap”: heap with smallest element being the “most extreme”

Heaps use complete (binary) trees* as the underlying structure, but are often implemented using arrays

Note: Not to be confused with binary *search* trees.

## Heap in C++

`std::make_heap()` is used to convert the given range in a container to a heap. Max heap by default. Use a custom comparator to change it to a min heap.

```cpp
// Initializing a vector
std::vector<int> v1 = { 20, 30, 40, 25, 15 };

// Converting vector into a heap
std::make_heap(v1.begin(), v1.end());

std::cout << v1.front() << '\n'; // Displays max element of heap
```

`std::push_heap(begin_iterator, end_iterator)` sorts the heap after insertion. Can you `push_back()` of vector class to insert.

```cpp
vector<int> vc{ 20, 30, 40, 10 };
make_heap(vc.begin(), vc.end());

vc.push_back(50);
push_heap(vc.begin(), vc.end()); // now the heap is sorted
```

Time Complexity: $O(log N)$

Note: The push_heap() function should only be used after the insertion of a single element at the back. Undefined for random insertion or for building a heap.

`pop_heap()` is used to move largest element of the heap to the end of the heap, so then a `pop_back()` can be used to remove the element

```cpp
pop_heap(vc.begin(), vc.end()); // moves largest element to the end
vc.pop_back(); // removes element at the end
```

Time Complexity: $O(logN)$

`sort_heap()` is used to sort the heap in ascending order using heapsort.

```cpp
sort_heap(v1.begin(), v1.end());
```

Time Complexity: $O(NlogN)$


`is_heap()` can be used to check whether a given range of the container is a heap. Default checks for max heap.
