## Definitions & Terminologies


## Representations

Adjacency Matrix, Distance Matrix, Adjacency List


## Shortest Path

Single-source shortest path, can solve with:

- DFS
  - Only works on trees
- BFS
  - Works for unweighted edges (or when all edges have same weight)
- Dijkstra's
  - Works for weighted edges
  

## Traveling Salesman Problem

Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?

I.e. given an undirected weighted graph, find a path that visits every node and returns to the first node with minimum total cost.




## Minimum Spanning Tree

Given: edge-weighted, undirected graph $G=(V,E)$

Find: subgraph $T=(V,E'), E' \subseteq E$ such that:

- All vertices are pair-wise connected
- The sum of all edge weights in $T$ is minimal

If there's a cycle in T, remove edge with highest weight

Therefore T must be a tree (since it must have no cycles)

Two algorithms to find MST:

- Prim's
- Kruskal's
