# Parallel Programming Models


**Programming Model Elements**

- Processes and Threads
  - Process
  - Thread
  - Task
- Communication
- Synchronization


## Message Passing

- Each process has their own local address space
- Cannot directly access memory of another node
- Use explicit send/receive operations

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous


## Shared Memory

- Multiple execution contexts shares single address space
- Communicate via loads and stores to shared memory

### Paired vs Separate Processor/Memory

- **Uniform Memory Access (UMA)**
  - 
- **Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)**
