# Cache Coherence

Cache coherence ensure that all processors in a system sees a consistent view of memory, even when multiple caches store copies of the same data.

Coherence can be thought of as two invariants:

- Single-Writer Multiple Readers (SWMR)
  - At any (logical) time, there is either only one writer or zero or more readers of a cache line
  - i.e. SWMR enforces that there is only one writer (if there is a writer at all) and that there can be as many readers when there is no writer
- Data Value Invariant (DVI)
  - All cores see the values of the address/line update in the same order
  - Everybody needs to agree on the ordering of the changes on the cache line

**Snooping Cache-Coherence Protocols**

- The bus provides serialization point
- Each cache controller snoops all bus transactions
  - then takes action to ensure coherence

## MSI Protocol

## MESI Protocol

- MSI suffers from frequent read-upgrade sequences
  - leads to two bus transactions
- Solution: Add exclusive state
  - Exclusive - only one copy; writable; clean
  - Stores make it transition to modified to indicate data is dirty
  - We'll be able to read with "write" permissions so the line is clean and we haven't written to it yet

To sum:

- Reduce unnecessary writebacks
  - Faster S->M transition if there are no other readers
    - In MSI, S->M requires sending invalidates
  - If we're the exclusive reader E, can directly change to M state on a store
- Reduce bus traffic (as above)


## MOESI Protocol

- M->S requires writing the modified value back to memory
  - Writebacks to mem may be unnecessary
- With an O state, cache can supply modified data to other caches, avoiding memory writeback
  - On eviction, Owner is responsible for writeback
- Going to O vs M
  - We go to O when another processor wants to get data (down-grade from M)

- Why? Bus-based coherence doesn't scale well
